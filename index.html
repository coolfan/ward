<P> Have you ever struggled with room draw? Been lost in a labarynth like room draw guide, full of the pitfalls of outdated information?
Felt like you knew so little about the rooms that were available that you were playing russian roulette? Wished you could benefit from an
easy to use system to make all your room draw decisions? Then wait no longer! With WARD you can access the wisdom of those who came before you through reviews
and a comprehensive draw guide, along with likelihood predictors to help you figure out if you will be able to select a room. Choose WARD - room DRAW service at its best.

<P>
    Check out our site at <a href="http://rooms.cs.princeton.edu/">rooms.cs.princeton.edu</a>

<p> The 5 course instructors were given fake room draw times and all put in the same draw group, so you should be able to access
    all the features of our website simply by logging in through CAS.

<P> Please email all the group members (ezlatin@, apalcoz@, yanjuny@, tando@, je7@) if anything goes wrong, and we will respond ASAP.

<P> The report and product guide links must point to PDF files <b>with <i>exactly</i> the
