The size wouldn't be as big of a deal if it wasn't for the fact that the placement of the closets and the window isle make it impossible to have any space in this room if you are not willing to keep the beds bunked.

The individual bedrooms are huge (about the same size as a regular Whitman single); the three west-facing rooms are the same size, while the east-facing bedroom is a little smaller but still pretty big. Heating/temperature control was hit-or-miss at the beginning of the year but I'll chalk that one up to Whitman transitioning to the fancy new system in summer 2017. Love, love, love this room, but you will absolutely need to get furniture and stuff to fill it up because it's so huge (the opposite of a problem, I know). If you have the opportunity to draw any of the big quingles in Whitman (above 1000 square feet), go for it. "

Almost seems that it was meant to be a triple. However, it's overall not too bad. Some people like bunk beds. Climbing to the top can be a bit of an ordeal, but not too difficult. We are right next to the bathroom and a drinking fountain. There's a kitchen which is locked (I guess it's more of a private kitchen) but we have microwaves in the basement! Someone stole them once, but the University got new ones so it didn't suck too terribly. Just used hot water for ramen for a little bit. We get a lot of natural light, and the common room is a really decent size. If you were to debunk in the smaller room, you could even move the bed into the common room instead. You can't really control the air conditioning in here, so it was pretty bad in the summer, but not unbearable. Just dress appropriately! We're about 5 minutes from the dining hall, but like 2 minutes from the U-Store. I am quite ashamed of the amount of times I've gone to the U-Store to satiate my kettle corn cravings. But it's right there! You'll understand if you pick this room. We had a minor ladybug infestation, but I don't think they'll be returning. I promise that I'm not the devil incarnate, but I had to spray Raid in where I thought they were nesting. They were buzzing around scaring the heck out of me! And at night, that's really annoying.

Mostly cause it's far away but also because it smells bad. Like sweat and whatever the hell drips through the ceiling. My hallmate wakes up to yellow shit on his face twice a week. Even when it doesn't rain. Get used to living with the window open because the outside temperatures are more reliable than Forbes' heating system.

My advice- get a squad together and just ride it out. Solidarity is gonna be your only asset. "

Bathroom is a little wack but works fine. Only quarrel is the noise being on the ground floor, but that’s just a facet of living on the first floor so not much you can do. Also be careful with the windows, I wish I could have opened them more but it’s a bit awkward to open them right in front of a walkway."

411,4/23/2018 19:01:34,Brown 329,5,3,5,3,4,2,"Brown 329 has been one of my favorite rooms at Princeton, despite the many negative aspects. I lived in Scully junior year, and the only reasons why my Scully room would be slightly better is because of the private bathroom and the elevators (Brown has no elevators fyi). It was also slightly closer to the kitchenette, which can be a deal breaker if you're independent. 

The space in Brown 329 is incomparable. In addition to what we usually get in a room, I was able to comfortably fit a full-sized futon, an ottoman, two 5x7 rugs, a coffee table, and a mini fridge with enough room to do yoga (lol). It is super close to the Women's bathroom. The Men's bathroom is on the other side of the building, which is also where the kitchen is located. The heater in the ""living room"" just does not work, so I had to open the windows most days (even in the winter) so the room wouldn't feel like sauna. The one in the bedroom won't turn on, but it's not much of a problem, especially since the heater in the living room is so hot that it warms both rooms. The walls are also SUPER  thin. Also, if you hate insects (especially of the centipede variety), beware. Cuyler doesn't have laundry, so the laundry room in Brown is often crowded. Most of the dryers don't work either. None of these were huge inconveniences for me, and I think I'm pretty picky, but they are all things worth keeping in mind."

The third floor used to be an office space. There is a room in the floor that serves as a common room. Insanely nice. Amazing bathrooms. Everything is wonderful. Proximity to the dining hall and everything in Wilcox (JStreet library, Blackbox theater, Butler library, Wu common space, all the offices, everything!) is obviously right here, can be accessed without going outside. Wilcox is essentially the best dorm hall in all of Wilson, but it is only for freshmen, so I am not sure how this will factor into your app. Good luck with your app!"

Also a fire escape that's great to chill on in warm weather. You can't really unbunk the beds though. Overall, pretty nice quad. "

The wardrobes are tiny. The space between beds after debunked is just enough for 1.5 person to pass. Common room is relatively large. "

Cons: Common room is oblong and a weird shape; The single is pretty small, and the double is on the smaller side (but is still decent); Henry is loud and gross. One thing to note is that the room next door has a balcony they can get out onto which looks directly into the windows of the single and the common room, so be careful!"
